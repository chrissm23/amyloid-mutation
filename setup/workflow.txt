1. Get data about the structure
  - What residues are there
  - How many chains are there
  - Arrange how the chains will be mutated
  - Create amyloid mutations
  - What is the charge of WT and mutants
  - Determine what the best order of adding ions is:
    * If they have same charge sign, then add ions to least charged first 
    * If they have opposite charge sign, add ions to WT first, then add ions
      to mutant, then delete excess of ions

2. Add water and ions
  - Solvate WT and all mutants
  - Strip water
  - Add ions according to above order and strip water with ions and amyloid
    with ions just in case.

3. Intercalate chains of WT and each mutant and merge
  - Create a PDB for each mutant intercalated with WT
  - Get chains and residues to add to tiMerge
  - Combine with respective solvent
  - Merge according to above data

4. Copy and complete templates
  - Copy templates to corresponding directories and complete with corresponding
    masks
